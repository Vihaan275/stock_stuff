# Strategy Playground

Welcome to my personal playground for testing and experimenting with different strategies. This repository is my sandbox for exploring ideas, learning from failures, and refining methods in a hands-on way.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Vihaan! This repo is where I document my journey of experimenting with various stock market strategies

The goal of this repository is to:

- **Experiment Freely:** Try out new ideas and strategies without worrying about perfection.
- **Document Learnings:** Keep track of what works, what doesnâ€™t, and why.
- **Improve Skills:** Enhance my understanding of strategy design, testing, and analysis.
- **Share Insights:** Provide a space for others to learn from my trials (and errors).


## How I Work

1. **Idea:** Start with a hypothesis or strategy concept.
2. **Implementation:** Build a script or model to test the strategy.
3. **Backtest:** Run historical simulations to evaluate performance.
4. **Analysis:** Record metrics, insights, and areas for improvement.
5. **Iteration:** Refine, tweak, and repeat based on results.

## Notes

- All experiments are personal and educational.
- Strategies here may not be ready for live trading.
- Contributions or collaboration ideas are welcome,especially if you want to discuss approaches or share insights.

## License

This project is for personal experimentation. Ideas can be referenced, but commercial use requires permission.
